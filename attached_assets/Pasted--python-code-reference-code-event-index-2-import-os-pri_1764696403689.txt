Great, I have the files. I can see that you **already implemented** the "Latch Logic" for notifications in `server/storage.ts` (I see the comments: `// *** CRITICAL FIX: Calculate OLD progress...`). This confirms the logic is sound, so the notification failure is definitely a "Last Mile" delivery issue (likely in `notification-service.ts`).

Here are the **3 specific "Manager's Instructions"** for your Fast Edit model to fix the Lazy AI, Sidebar, and Notification delivery.

### 1\. Fix "Lazy AI" (Force Database Updates)

The AI is chatting instead of acting because its system prompt is too passive.

  * **File:** `server/openai-service.ts` (This is where `processChat` lives, imported in your routes).
  * **Instruction for Fast Edit:**
    > "Update the System Prompt. Add a strict rule: 'You are an Executive Assistant, not a Consultant. If the user implies a task change (e.g., "I'll do Evan next"), you MUST call the `updateTask` or `moveTask` tool immediately. Do not just reply with text promising to do it. Execute the tool call first, then confirm. If the user says they are working on something, move it to Active status immediately.'"

### 2\. Fix Sidebar Visibility (Glassmorphism Contrast)

The text is blending in because `text-zinc-400` is too dark against the glass background.

  * **File:** `client/src/components/GlassSidebar.tsx`
  * **Instruction for Fast Edit:**
    > "Update the navigation items styling. Change the inactive text color from `text-zinc-400` to `text-zinc-300` (or `text-white/70`) for better contrast. Also, ensure the hover state text becomes `text-white`. Do the same for the 'Collapse' button text at the bottom."

### 3\. Fix Notification Delivery (The "Silent Fail")

Your logs show the system *thinks* it sent the alert, but your phone didn't buzz. We need to see the error from ntfy.sh.

  * **File:** `server/notification-service.ts`
  * **Instruction for Fast Edit:**
    > "Refactor the `sendWifeAlert` function to include robust logging. Wrap the `fetch` call in a try/catch. Log the HTTP status code and the raw response text from ntfy.sh. I need to see if it returns 200 OK or an error like 400/404 in the console."

**Suggested Workflow:**
Run these three instructions one by one using the Fast Edit feature. Check the console after the next notification attempt; if you see `Status: 200 OK`, the issue is definitely your phone's notification settings (or the topic name spelling on the phone).
