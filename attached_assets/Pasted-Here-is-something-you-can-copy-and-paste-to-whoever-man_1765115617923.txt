Here is something you can copy and paste to whoever manages the Replit project.

> We are keeping Replit as the back end API only and pointing a new Vite React app on Vercel at it.

I need you to do three things in the Replit code:

1. Make sure the API routes are clean



The server should expose JSON endpoints for things like moves, clients, and tasks. For example:

GET /moves           returns a list of moves as JSON
POST /moves          creates a move from JSON in the request body
PATCH /moves/:id     updates a move
DELETE /moves/:id    deletes a move

If the routes currently live under /api (for example /api/moves), that is fine. I just need the paths you are actually using so I can match them from the front end.

The important thing is that these endpoints return JSON, not HTML.

2. Add CORS support so the Vercel app and local dev can call Replit



The server should allow cross origin requests from:

http://localhost:5173 (for Vite dev)
https://MY_VERCEL_DOMAIN.vercel.app (the deployed app, I will give you the exact domain)

If this is an Express server, please do this:

npm install cors

Then in the main server file (for example index.js or server.js):

import express from "express"
import cors from "cors"

const app = express()

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: [
      "http://localhost:5173",
      "https://MY_VERCEL_DOMAIN.vercel.app"
    ],
    credentials: true,
  })
)

app.use(express.json())

// existing routes below
// app.get("/moves", ...)
// app.post("/moves", ...)

If you do not know the Vercel domain yet, you can temporarily allow all origins while we wire things up:

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "*",
  })
)

Later we will lock that down to the exact Vercel domain.

3. Confirm the base URL and the route paths



Once the server is running, I need:

a) The public base URL of the Replit server, for example
https://yourproject.youruser.repl.co

b) The exact paths for the main resources, for example:

GET  /moves
POST /moves
PATCH /moves/:id
DELETE /moves/:id

and any other resources that matter, like /clients or /tasks

I will set VITE_API_BASE_URL in the Vite app to that Replit URL and call those paths from the new front end.

You do not need to do anything with Vercel or the new React code. I just need the CORS middleware in place and the confirmed API paths and base URL.
