## Changes Made to SaaS Dashboard

**Radix UI Icon Replacements:**

- Replaced emoji icons with Radix UI icons throughout the dashboard for a more professional appearance
- Added icons: `TargetIcon`, `BarChartIcon`, `MixIcon`, `ClockIcon`, `ArchiveIcon`, `PersonIcon`, `ChevronDownIcon` from `@radix-ui/react-icons`
- Applied icons to section headers with consistent styling (8x8 icon containers with cyan/zinc backgrounds and rounded corners)


**Work Type Breakdown:**

- Changed layout from horizontal (number + "moves" side-by-side) to vertical stacking
- Count numbers now display prominently on top in large, bold text (text-2xl font-bold)
- Type names (Deep, Comms, Creative, etc.) shown below in smaller, muted text (text-xs text-zinc-500)
- Removed "moves" label entirely to save space and reduce clutter
- Each item displays as a centered column (flex-col items-start) in a 2-column grid


**Weekly Trends Chart:**

- Fixed bar rendering with pixel-based height calculations (140px container)
- Bars now properly scale based on move count with 12px minimum height for visibility
- Only bars with values > 0 are rendered to show actual activity days
- Maintained the momentum score display (82) and "Unstoppable Flow" status
- Fixed empty chart issue where bars weren't displaying at all
- Replaced emoji icon with Radix UI `BarChartIcon`


**Productivity Rhythm Chart:**

- Reduced number of displayed bars from all 18 hours to every other hour (9 bars total)
- Simplified time labels to show only numeric values (6, 7, 8, 9, etc.) without AM/PM suffixes
- Fixed bar height calculations using pixel-based heights (160px container with 24px minimum bars)
- Reduced horizontal padding (px-3) and gaps (gap-1.5) to maximize chart space
- Font size reduced to text-[9px] for compact mobile display
- Replaced emoji icon with Radix UI `ClockIcon`


**Bug Fixes:**

- Suppressed benign ResizeObserver error by adding global error handlers (window.error, unhandledrejection, console.error interception)
- Fixed empty chart rendering issues by ensuring explicit pixel heights instead of percentage-based heights
- Prevented time label overflow with proper container constraints


**Additional Icon Updates:**

- Today's Pacing: `TargetIcon` with cyan background
- Work Type Breakdown: `MixIcon` with cyan background
- Backlog Health: `ArchiveIcon` with zinc background
- Client Activity: `PersonIcon` with zinc background
- Dropdown indicators: `ChevronDownIcon` for sentiment and priority selectors


These changes created a more polished, professional mobile-optimized dashboard with consistent iconography and improved data visualization.
