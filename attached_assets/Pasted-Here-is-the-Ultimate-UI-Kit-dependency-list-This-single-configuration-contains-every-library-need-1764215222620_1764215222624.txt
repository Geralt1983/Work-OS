Here is the "Ultimate UI Kit" dependency list. This single configuration contains every library needed to build all three styles (Linear, Amie, and Arc) without needing to reinstall packages later.
You can copy this directly into your Replit package.json file.
The "Ultimate UI" Package.json
This list includes the Core Engine (React + Vite), the Styling Layer (Tailwind), and the "Secret Sauce" libraries that top-tier developers use for that premium feel.

The "Secret Sauce" Breakdown
Here is why these specific libraries are in the list. These are the industry standards for "slick" UIs in 2025:
 * framer-motion: The physics engine for the web. It powers the "bouncy" feel of Amie and the smooth layout transitions of Arc.
 * cmdk: This is the exact library used by Linear, Raycast, and Vercel to build their command palettes (Cmd+K menus). It handles the accessible keyboard navigation automatically.
 * vaul: A "Drawer" component that mimics the iOS pull-up sheet perfectly. It allows you to drag a modal down to close it with momentum, a key feature of the Arc mobile vibe.
 * sonner: The current gold standard for "Toast" notifications (the little pop-ups that say "Copied to clipboard"). It is stackable, swipeable, and looks incredible out of the box.
 * tailwind-merge & clsx: These are utility essentials. They allow you to combine Tailwind classes conditionally without breaking your styles (e.g., clsx("p-4", isSelected && "bg-blue-500")).
Quick Install Command
If you are already in a Replit shell or terminal, you can just paste this single line to install everything at once:
npm install framer-motion cmdk vaul sonner clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority lucide-react

Next Step
Now that you have the engine ready, would you like the React code for one of the specific "Signature Components"?
 * Option A: The Linear Command Palette (The floating search bar).
 * Option B: The Amie Task Card (The bouncy, checkable list item).
 * Option C: The Arc Sidebar (The glassmorphism navigation panel).
