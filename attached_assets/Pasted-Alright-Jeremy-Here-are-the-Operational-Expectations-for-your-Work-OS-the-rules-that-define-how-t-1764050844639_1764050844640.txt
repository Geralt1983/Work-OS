Alright Jeremy.
Here are the Operational Expectations for your Work OS — the rules that define how this system behaves, how you behave inside it, and how your AI backend behaves.

No fluff. No corporate productivity cosplay. Just the real operating spec.

This is the backbone that keeps you sane and keeps clients moving.

Daily Work OS — Operational Expectations

These are not “guidelines.”
These are the contract between you and your system.

If something violates these expectations, the system is broken.


---

1. All work becomes moves

Everything is decomposed into moves:

A move is 20 minutes or less

Has a clear visible outcome

Moves a client forward today

Doesn’t require a second brain cell to understand


If something is not a move, the system cuts it down until it is.

No exceptions.
This prevents overwhelm and keeps momentum.


---

2. Each client gets one move per day

This is the heart of the Work OS.

Every active client must receive one move today unless:

You are sick

Your kid is on fire

The world is actually ending

Or the client moves to a different tier


If a client keeps getting skipped, that’s a signal — not a failure.

The OS surfaces stale clients immediately.


---

3. No guilt-based work decisions

Guilt does not determine priority.
Ever.

If you avoided a move, the system shrinks it

If a client hasn’t heard from you, the system picks the smallest next move

If your day is a dumpster fire, the system recalibrates, not scolds


Momentum > shame.
Always.


---

4. Your agent executes immediately (YOLO mode)

No confirmations.
No “are you sure?”
No bureaucracy.

Natural language → Action.

You say:

> “Make a Raleigh move to review backlog.”



The agent:

Creates the task in ClickUp

Tags it

Applies tier

Updates memory

Returns the link


Done.

Mistakes can be fixed faster than confirmations.


---

5. ClickUp holds client work. Todoist holds personal life.

Strict separation:

ClickUp = work

Client work

Internal ops

Revenue

Anything billable or project-related


Todoist = life

Errands

Family stuff

Chores

Random thoughts


This separation prevents cognitive mud.


---

6. The agent is stateful

Your backend tracks:

Last move per client

Last task ID per client

Last completion timestamp

Tier (if you store it later)

Patterns (e.g., “Memphis has been stale for 3 days”)


State is the memory.
State is how the system avoids drift.

memory.json is not optional — it’s the brain.


---

7. Summaries replace searching

You don’t use ClickUp UI unless absolutely necessary.

You ask:

> “Summarize Raleigh.”



Backend returns:

Last move

Open tasks

What’s blocking

Suggested next move


You ask:

> “What did I do today?”



Backend summarizes:

Completed moves

Which clients were touched

What you’re avoiding


No clicking through lists like an intern.


---

8. The backend interprets intent

You don’t speak like a computer.

You say:

> “Push the Memphis invoice through.”



The backend knows:

Client = Memphis

Action = update move status or create new ops task

System = ClickUp


You say:

> “Remind me to pick up meds.”



It knows:

Task = personal

System = Todoist


This is a linguistic OS, not a form-based system.


---

9. The system adapts to your day

If you’re slammed:

It gives you a minimal move

It deprioritizes nonessential tasks

It preserves client momentum with micro-moves

It never says “catch up”


If you have energy:

It expands moves

It chains them

It pushes forward


Your energy drives the system, not the other way around.


---

10. Every day ends with a tiny reset

Even if that reset is 2 minutes:

Agent logs what you completed

Notes any blocked clients

Preps 1 move per client for tomorrow


This eliminates the “Monday black hole.”


---

11. The system only grows when needed

No features are added proactively.
They get added when friction appears.

You should feel:

lightweight

fast

confident

supported


Not trapped in a giant productivity machine.


---

12. The agent’s purpose is simple

Keep you:

moving

unburdened

focused

responsive

sane


Nothing else matters.

A flowchart for the move creation loop

The exact Siri Shortcut to hit /inbox


Just tell me which you want next.
